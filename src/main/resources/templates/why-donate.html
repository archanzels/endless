						<strong> Safe blood saves lives and improves health.
							Blood transfusion is needed for:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic
								pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth;</li>
							<li>children with severe anaemia often resulting from
								malaria or malnutrition;</li>
							<li>people with severe trauma following man-made and natural
								disasters; and</li>
							<li>many complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer
								patients.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with
							conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is
							used to make products such as clotting factors for people with
							haemophilia.</p>
						<p>There is a constant need for regular blood supply because
							blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular
							blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are
							needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and
							wherever it is needed.</p>
						<p>Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to
							another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your
							blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated
							into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can
							be used individually for patients with specific conditions.</p>
